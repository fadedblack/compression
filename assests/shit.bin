If this is your first time, 
the documentation for the standard 
library is written to be casually perused. 
Clicking on interesting things should generally lead you to interesting places. 
Still, there are important bits you don’t want to miss, so read on for a tour of the
standard library and its documentation!

Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library you may 
begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At this stage in your 
development you may want to press the [-] button near the top of the page to 
collapse it into a more skimmable view.

While you are looking at that [-] button also notice the source link. 
Rust’s API documentation comes with the source code and you are encouraged to read it. 
The standard library source is generally high quality and a peek behind the curtains is 
often enlightening.
